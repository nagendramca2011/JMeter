Using JMeter behind a proxy
=========================== 

If you are testing from behind a firewall/proxy server, you may need to provide JMeter with the firewall/proxy server hostname and port number. To do so, run the `jmeter[.bat]` file from a command line with the following parameters:

> -H
[proxy server hostname or ip address]

> -P
[proxy server port]

> -N
[nonproxy hosts] (e.g. *.apache.org|localhost)

> -u
[username for proxy authentication - if required]

> -a
[password for proxy authentication - if required]

Example:
```
jmeter -H my.proxy.server -P 8000 -u username -a password -N localhost
```
You can also use `--proxyHost`, `--proxyPort` `--username`, and `--password` as parameter names

```
Parameters provided on a command-line may be visible to other users on the system.
```
If the proxy host and port are provided, then JMeter sets the following System properties:

* http.proxyHost
* http.proxyPort
* https.proxyHost
* https.proxyPort

If a nonproxy host list is provided, then JMeter sets the following System properties:
* http.nonProxyHosts
* https.nonProxyHosts

So if you don't wish to set both http and https proxies, you can define the relevant properties in `system.properties` instead of using the command-line parameters.

Proxy Settings can also be defined in a Test Plan, using either the HTTP Request Defaults configuration or the HTTP Request sampler elements.


>JMeter also has its own in-built Proxy Server, the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder. This is only used for recording HTTP or HTTPS browser sessions. This is not to be confused with the proxy settings described above, which are used when JMeter makes HTTP or HTTPS requests itself.
