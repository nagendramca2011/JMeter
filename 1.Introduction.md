JMeter
=========================== 

Apache JMeter is open source software, a 100% pure Java desktop application, designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance of web sites. It was originally designed for load testing web applications but has since expanded to other test functions.

* Correct sizing of Java Heap. By default JMeter runs with a heap of 512MB, this might not be enough for your test and depends on your test plan and number of threads you want to run
