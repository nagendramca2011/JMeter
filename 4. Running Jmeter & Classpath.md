Running JMeter
=========================== 

```
GUI mode should only be used for creating the test script, NON GUI mode must be used for load testing
```

> jmeter.bat

run JMeter (in GUI mode by default)

> jmeterw.cmd

run JMeter without the windows shell console (in GUI mode by default)

> jmeter-n.cmd

drop a JMX file on this to run a non-GUI test

> jmeter-n-r.cmd

drop a JMX file on this to run a non-GUI test remotely

> jmeter-t.cmd

drop a JMX file on this to load it in GUI mode

> jmeter-server.bat

start JMeter in server mode

> mirror-server.cmd

runs the JMeter Mirror Server in non-GUI mode

> shutdown.cmd

Run the Shutdown client to stop a non-GUI instance gracefully

> stoptest.cmd

Run the Shutdown client to stop a non-GUI instance abruptly

```
The special name LAST can be used with jmeter-n.cmd, jmeter-t.cmd and jmeter-n-r.cmd and means the last test plan that was run interactively.
```

The environment variable JVM_ARGS can be used to override JVM settings in the jmeter.bat script. For example:

```
set JVM_ARGS="-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -Dpropname=propvalue"
jmeter -t test.jmx â€¦
```

JMeter's Classpath
=========================== 

JMeter automatically finds classes from jars in the following directories:

> JMETER_HOME/lib

used for utility jars

> JMETER_HOME/lib/ext

used for JMeter components and plugins

If you have developed new JMeter components, then you should jar them and copy the jar into JMeter's lib/ext directory. JMeter will automatically find JMeter components in any jars found here. Do not use lib/ext for utility jars or dependency jars used by the plugins; it is only intended for JMeter components and plugins.

If you don't want to put JMeter plugin jars in the` lib/ext` directory, then define the property `search_paths` in `jmeter.properties`.

Utility and dependency jars (libraries etc) can be placed in the `lib` directory.

If you don't want to put such jars in the `lib` directory, then define the property `user.classpath` or `plugin_dependency_paths in jmeter.properties`. See below for an explanation of the differences.

Other jars (such as JDBC, JMS implementations and any other support libraries needed by the JMeter code) should be placed in the lib directory - not the `lib/ext` directory, or added to user.classpath.

```
JMeter will only find .jar files, not .zip.
```

You can also install utility Jar files in `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext`, or you can set the property `user.classpath` in `jmeter.properties`

Note that setting the `CLASSPATH` environment variable will have no effect. This is because JMeter is started with "java -jar", and the java command silently ignores the `CLASSPATH` variable, and the `-classpath/-cp` options when `-jar` is used.
