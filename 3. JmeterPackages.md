JMeter Packages
=========================== 

> Java Compiler

If you want to build the JMeter source or develop JMeter plugins, then you will need a fully compliant JDK 8 or higher.

> SAX XML Parser

Meter comes with Apache's Xerces XML parser. You have the option of telling JMeter to use a different XML parser. To do so, include the classes for the third-party parser in JMeter's classpath, and update the jmeter.properties file with the full classname of the parser implementation.

> Email Support

JMeter has extensive Email capabilities. It can send email based on test results, and has a POP3(S)/IMAP(S) sampler. It also has an SMTP(S) sampler.

> SSL Encryption

To test a web server using SSL encryption (HTTPS), JMeter requires that an implementation of SSL be provided.

> JDBC Driver

You will need to add your database vendor's JDBC driver to the classpath if you want to do JDBC testing. Make sure the file is a jar file, not a zip.

>  JMS client
JMeter now includes the JMS API from Apache Geronimo, so you just need to add the appropriate JMS Client implementation jar(s) from the JMS provider. Please refer to their documentation for details. 

> Libraries for ActiveMQ JMS

You will need to add the jar activemq-all-X.X.X.jar to your classpath, e.g. by storing it in the lib/ directory.
